# BCN3DSigma
A very brief overview of the modifications I've made to my BCN3D Sigma R17 over the last few years.

This has been a very meandering project for me, and is something I work on whenever I'm back from school and have a few spare days. As such, the files have become very disorganized over the years so provided here is what I think is the latest version of everything (configs and STL/3MFs - most of the parts were designed in Fusion360 so it's a big faf to download the archive files) and some pictures of its current state.

#### Here is a list of (most) of the changes I've made:
- Replaced Bondtech bowden extruders with direct drive Hemera extruders
  - I was frustrated with how frequently the default extruders jammed, even after upgrading to the insanely expensive Bondtech ones especially since they were hidden behind the spools. Although the Hemeras reduce the useable xy print area slightly and increase the mass of the x-axis, their reliability and print quality is a godsend and it also allows the printer to use 1.75mm filament, which is nice since 3mm is getting harder to find
